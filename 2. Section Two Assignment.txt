Visualize and Compare Random Protein Structures

Simulate and compare the energy of two random 3D protein structures, each with 10 amino acids. Visualize both, compute their energy, and explain which one is more stable.

Assignment Instructions
1. Write a function to generate a list of 10 random 3D positions for amino acids.
2. Use your energy function from the coding exercise to compute total energy.
3. Generate two different random structures, and compute energy for each.
4. Compare their energies and print which one is more stable (lower energy).

(Optional for offline users): Visualize both structures using text (index + coordinates) or use your local Python with matplotlib.

Deliverables:
Code that:
Generates random 3D positions
Computes energy
Compares two structures
Printed output showing:
Energy values for both structures
Which one is more stable

Q1. After comparing the energies of your two random protein structures, which one was more stable, and why?

Q2. How does adjusting amino acid positions affect the total energy, and what does this tell you about protein folding in nature?
