Instructions:
Write a one-page explanation (200–300 words) comparing at least three types of optimization algorithms (e.g., Gradient-Based, Gradient-Free, Metaheuristics).

For each, describe:
How it works conceptually
One real-world example of its use
Whether it relies on derivatives or not
Submission Format: Text entry or PDF upload
Evaluation: Based on clarity, correctness, and examples provided.

Q1. In your own words, explain what an optimization algorithm does and why it is important in artificial intelligence and engineering.

Q2. Describe a Gradient-Based optimization algorithm and give one example of where it is commonly used.

Q3. What are Metaheuristic algorithms, and why are they often used for complex or real-world problems?
