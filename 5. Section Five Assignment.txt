Analyze and Explain PSO-Based Antenna Optimization

In this assignment, you will reflect on the concepts behind optimizing antenna geometry using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
You’ll explain how the algorithm evaluates antenna designs, why smoothness and efficiency matter, and what advantages PSO provides over traditional optimization methods.

Assignment Instructions
In this assignment, you will reflect on the concepts behind optimizing antenna geometry using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
You’ll explain how the algorithm evaluates antenna designs, why smoothness and efficiency matter, and what advantages PSO provides over traditional optimization methods.

Q1. Explain in your own words how the objective function helps PSO decide which antenna designs are better.
(Hint: Think about total length and bending smoothness.)

Q2. Why does the optimization process include both a “length” term and a “bending penalty”?
(Hint: What happens if we remove one of them?)

Q3. Describe one main reason Particle Swarm Optimization is preferred over manual or analytical antenna design approaches.
(Hint: Consider complexity, flexibility, or convergence behavior.)
