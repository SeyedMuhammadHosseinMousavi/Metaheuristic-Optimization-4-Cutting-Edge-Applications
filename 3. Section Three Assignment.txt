Simulating Energy-Efficient Paths in Warped Space-Time

Simulate a simplified space-time warping scenario using an objective function that minimizes energy costs from distance, bending, and warp-field distortion. Apply one iteration of the Firefly Algorithm to find the most efficient path from a start to an end point and analyze the impact of the warp.

Assignment Instructions
1. Define Your Scenario:
Choose your own start and end coordinates.
Create a warp_field vector to simulate space-time distortion (e.g., [0.3, -0.2]).
Set a bending penalty (lambda_bend) between 0.1 and 1.0.

2. Implement the Objective Function:

Write a Python function that takes x, start, end, lambda_bend, and warp_field as inputs and returns the total energy cost.

3. Simulate Firefly Movement:
Generate a random population of positions in 2D space.
Apply one iteration of the movement rule from the Firefly Algorithm.
Track changes in positions and compute new objective values.

4. Analysis:
Print the best position found and its final energy cost.
Briefly describe (2–3 lines) how the warp field influenced the optimizer's behavior.

Q1. Explain how the warp field affects the optimization process in your simulation.

Q2. What role does the bending penalty play in shaping the fireflies’ movement?

Q3. If you were to run the simulation for multiple iterations, what behavior would you expect from the swarm and why?
